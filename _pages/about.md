Hi, nice to meet you! I’m Xu Jundong, an incoming PhD Student at the National University of Singapore (NUS) CTIC lab, working under the supervision of Prof. [Mong-Li Lee](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~leeml/) and Prof. [Wynne Hsu](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~whsu/). I am also mentored by Dr. [Hao Fei](https://haofei.vip/). Previously, I earned a Master of Computing from NUS and a BSc from University College London (UCL). My research interests focus on AI reasoning, particularly in logical and symbolic reasoning.

I enjoy collaborating and learning from diverse perspectives. Feel free to email me if you'd like to discuss research!

<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kx4xFzMAAAAJ&hl=en'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kx4xFzMAAAAJ&hl=en'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->
