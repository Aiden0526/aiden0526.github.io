Hi, nice to meet you! I‚Äôm Xu Jundong, currently a research assistant at the CTIC Lab at the National University of Singapore (NUS), working under the supervision of Prof. [Mong-Li Lee](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~leeml/) and Prof. [Wynne Hsu](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~whsu/). I am also mentored by Dr. [Hao Fei](https://haofei.vip/). Previously, I earned a Master of Computing from NUS and a BSc from University College London (UCL). My research interests focus on AI reasoning, particularly in logical and symbolic reasoning.

I enjoy collaborating and learning from diverse perspectives. Feel free to email me if you'd like to discuss research!

Miscellaneous
------
I love sports, especially basketball, tennis, and skiing. I'm a big fan of the Golden State Warriors and Stephen Curry, and I also admire Roger Federer.
I enjoy reading books, and some of my favorites include Narcissus and Goldmund by Hermann Hesse and A New Earth by Eckhart Tolle.
I also love watching movies. Some of my favorites are Fight Club by David Fincher and A Confucian Confusion by Edward Yang.

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

For more info
------
More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
