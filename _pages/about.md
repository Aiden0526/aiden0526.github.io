Hi, nice to meet you! I‚Äôm Xu Jundong, currently a research assistant at the CTIC Lab at the National University of Singapore (NUS), working under the supervision of Prof. [Mong-Li Lee](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~leeml/) and Prof. [Wynne Hsu](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~whsu/). I am also mentored by Dr. [Hao Fei](https://haofei.vip/). Previously, I earned a Master of Computing from NUS and a BSc from University College London (UCL). My research interests focus on AI reasoning, particularly in logical and symbolic reasoning.

I enjoy collaborating and learning from diverse perspectives. Feel free to email me if you'd like to discuss research!

Miscellaneous
------
I love sports, especially basketball, tennis, and skiing. I'm a big fan of the Golden State Warriors and Stephen Curry, and I also admire Roger Federer.
I enjoy reading books, and some of my favorites include Narcissus and Goldmund by Hermann Hesse and A New Earth by Eckhart Tolle.
I also love watching movies. Some of my favorites are Fight Club by David Fincher and A Confucian Confusion by Edward Yang.
